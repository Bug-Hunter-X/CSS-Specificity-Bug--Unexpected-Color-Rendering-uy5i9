# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Color Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS where specificity rules can lead to unexpected behavior across different browsers.

The `bug.css` file contains CSS code exhibiting this problem, resulting in inconsistent color rendering depending on the browser. The `bugSolution.css` offers a solution to ensure consistent color application.

## Problem

The main problem stems from the intricacies of CSS specificity.  Certain selectors, like IDs and classes combined, may not consistently override other selectors as expected due to how browsers resolve conflicting styles.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.css` addresses the specificity issues by employing techniques to improve the predictability and consistency of style application across different browsers.  This might involve carefully managing selector specificity, optimizing CSS structure, or potentially using the `!important` flag (with caution).
