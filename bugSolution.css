To solve the specificity issue, we can improve the order of styles or add more weight to the selector which we want to have more precedence.

```css
/*bugSolution.css*/
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myId {
  color: green;
}

#myId.myClass {
  color: purple !important; /* Using !important to ensure the purple color is applied */
}
```

Alternatively, we can restructure the CSS and use more specific selectors to control styles more predictably, minimizing the need for `!important`.
